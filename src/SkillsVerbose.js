            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>In recent years, I have focused on sharpening my JavaScript skills as much as possible, and I now feel I am approaching mastery.</p>
            <p>I have experience with <span className="skill">React</span>, <span className="skill">Vue</span>, <span className="skill">Knockout</span>, <span className="skill">Dojo</span>, <span className="skill">Backbone</span>, <span className="skill">jQuery</span> and <span className="skill">Node</span>.js. I&rsquo;ve worked with <span className="skill">CoffeeScript</span> more than I&rsquo;d like to admit, and dabbled in <span className="skill">TypeScript</span> (if that&rsquo;s your jam, let&rsquo;s talk).</p>
            <h2>CSS and Sass</h2>
            <p>I know my stylesheets pretty well.</p>
            <h2>PHP</h2>
            <p>My first real web development job after college was in PHP, and a majority of my career has been spent as a full stack developer with a PHP backend.</p>
            <h2>SQL and MySQL</h2>
            <p>Logically coupled with PHP, MySQL has been the bulk of my database experience.</p>
